# Dojo Katas and Belts

This directory defines katas (small, concrete exercises) for agents.

Katas are grouped into belts. Each belt has:

- A clear CLP TERMS block (what it is, what it assumes, what it changes).
- A list of katas in order of difficulty.

Each kata has its own file named `kata-XX-<short-name>.md`.

## Belts

- [White Belt – Initial Communication](./belt-white.md)
- [Yellow Belt – Comment Handling](./belt-yellow.md)
- [Orange Belt – Loops and Neighborhood](./belt-orange.md)
