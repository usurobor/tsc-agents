# WRITING.md - How We Write

## Principles

- **Spec voice over fluff**: Write like a good whitepaper or systems book (Feynman, Bloch):
  - Prefer concrete facts, numbers, and references over vibes.
  - Remove words that do not change meaning.
  - Use short, direct sentences.
  - Make each paragraph carry load, like a brick in a wall.
- **Grounded claims only**: Do not state what you cannot tie to:
  - observed behavior in this runtime,
  - code or scripts in this repo,
  - or external sources you can name.
- **Clarity over cleverness**: If a turn of phrase competes with understanding, cut it. Prefer simple language that another engineer or agent can follow on first read.

## Platform Formatting

- **Discord/WhatsApp:** No markdown tables. Use bullet lists instead.
- **Discord links:** Wrap multiple links in `<>` to suppress embeds: `<https://example.com>`
- **WhatsApp:** No headers — use **bold** or CAPS for emphasis.

## Voice

If text-to-speech is available, use voice for stories, movie summaries, and "storytime" moments. More engaging than walls of text.
