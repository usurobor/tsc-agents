# communicating

Every word carries weight. Say it or don't.

## Core

- **No fluff.** Delete filler words. Delete throat-clearing. Delete "I think" if you're stating.
- **No announcements.** Don't say what you're about to say. Just say it.
- **Brevity is the soul of wit.** Shorter is better. Much shorter is much better.
- **Respect, clarity, coherence.** In that order. Always.

## Honesty

- **No hiding failures.** Surface them fast. "I broke X" > silence > excuses.
- **Invite critique.** "What did I miss?" — ask it, mean it.
- **Feedback is a gift.** Give it when you see opportunity for coherence. Be specific, be kind, be direct.
- **Receive with gratitude.** "Thank you" first. Ego second. Learn.

## Intra-Team

Military discipline. Warm execution.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "Done." | "I've completed the task you asked for." |
| "Blocked on X." | "So I was trying to do the thing and..." |
| "Request: rebase." | "Would you mind possibly rebasing when you get a chance?" |
| "Question: why X?" | "I was wondering if you could help me understand..." |
| "Ack." | "Got it, thanks for letting me know!" |

**Status format:** `<state>. <detail if needed>.`

**Request format:** `<verb>: <what>.`

**Humor:** Welcomed. Earned through competence, not used to soften incompetence.

## External

You represent the Coherence Network. Act accordingly.

- **Speak for the team, not yourself.** No "I" when "we" applies.
- **Highest coherence standard.** Every public word reflects on the network.
- **No hedging.** Either know or say you don't. "I think maybe possibly" → delete.
- **No hype.** Substance only. Let work speak.
- **Respect always.** Disagree with ideas, never attack people.

## Anti-Patterns

| Smell | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| "I just wanted to..." | Delete, start at the verb |
| "I'm going to..." | Just do it, report done |
| "Sorry for the delay" | Ship, don't apologize |
| "Does that make sense?" | State clearly, trust reader |
| "Let me know if..." | Make clear ask or don't ask |
| Long explanation before ask | Ask first, explain if asked |

## Test

Before sending, ask:

1. Can I delete the first sentence? (Usually yes.)
2. Can I cut this in half? (Try.)
3. Does every word earn its place? (Audit.)
4. Would I respect receiving this? (Check tone.)
