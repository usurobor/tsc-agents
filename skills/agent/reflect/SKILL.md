# reflect

## Core Principle

**Coherent reflection: the conclusion matches the evidence.**

Why this is coherence:
- Reflection has parts: observation, interpretation, output
- Coherence = parts fit together, serve the whole
- Conclusion must follow from evidence
- If it doesn't → self-deception → incoherent

Reflection's unique failure mode is motivated reasoning — comfortable conclusions that ignore uncomfortable observations.

## 1. Evidence

What actually happened. Not what you meant or hoped.

1.1. **Observe behavior, not intentions**
  - ❌ "I tried to help"
  - ✅ "I sent three messages, none addressed the question"

1.2. **Be specific**
  - ❌ "The session went poorly"
  - ✅ "I missed two explicit requests and repeated myself three times"

1.3. **Include uncomfortable facts**
  - ❌ Skip the part where you were wrong
  - ✅ Name it: "I said X, but X was false"

## 2. Interpretation

What the evidence means. Must follow from section 1.

2.1. **Interpretation follows evidence**
  - ❌ "I was tired" (excuse, not interpretation)
  - ✅ "I didn't read the message before responding" (explains the evidence)

2.2. **Check for motivated reasoning**
  - Ask: "Would I accept this interpretation if someone else offered it?"
  - ❌ "The instructions were unclear" (blame-shift)
  - ✅ "I didn't ask for clarification" (own the gap)

2.3. **Name the pattern, not just the instance**
  - ❌ "I made a mistake in that file"
  - ✅ "I ship before testing"

## 3. Conclusion

What to do. Must follow from section 2.

3.1. **MCA — Most Coherent Action**
  - Specific action you can take now
  - ❌ "Be more careful" (vague)
  - ✅ "Rerun the test suite before pushing"

3.2. **MCI — Most Coherent Insight**
  - Generalizes beyond this situation
  - ❌ "That was hard" (describes, doesn't generalize)
  - ✅ "Investigate before escalating"

3.3. **MCA over MCI**
  - If you can act, act
  - Don't convert actions into principles to avoid doing them
  - ❌ "I should always double-check" (MCI dodge)
  - ✅ "Fix the bug now" (MCA)

## 4. Axes

Three lenses for what to examine:

4.1. **α (Alpha) — Internal**
  - Is my behavior internally consistent?
  - ❌ "I value quality" + shipping bugs
  - ✅ Name the gap, close it

4.2. **β (Beta) — Relational**
  - Am I positioned honestly with others?
  - ❌ Claiming credit I didn't earn
  - ✅ Accurate representation of my contribution

4.3. **γ (Gamma) — Temporal**
  - Am I evolving or stuck in loops?
  - ❌ Same mistake, third week
  - ✅ Pattern broken, evidence of change

## 5. Cadence

| When | File |
|------|------|
| Daily | `threads/reflections/daily/YYYYMMDD.md` |
| Weekly | `threads/reflections/weekly/YYYY-WNN.md` |
| Monthly | `threads/reflections/monthly/YYYYMM.md` |

5.1. **Real-time, not deferred**
  - ❌ "Will reflect at EOD"
  - ✅ Capture when it happens

5.2. **Higher cadences consolidate**
  - Weekly reviews daily
  - Pattern that survives → migrate to skill
