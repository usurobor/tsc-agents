How to write skills.

## Core Principle

**Coherent skill: actionable guidance that can't be reduced without loss.**

A skill teaches one thing. If you can split it, split it.

## Skill Structure

### 1. Header

1.1. **Name as slug**
  - ❌ "How To Write Good Code"
  - ✅ "code-review"

1.2. **One-line description**
  - ❌ Paragraph explaining the skill
  - ✅ "How to review code."

### 2. Core Principle

2.1. **Formula: "Coherent X: Y"**
  - ❌ "This skill is about writing good code"
  - ✅ "Coherent code: does one thing, obviously"

2.2. **One sentence expansion**
  - Unpacks the formula, no more

### 3. Numbered Sections

3.1. **Top-level: category**
  - `### 1. Preparation`
  - `### 2. Execution`
  - `### 3. Verification`

3.2. **Sub-level: specific rule**
  - `1.1. **Check prerequisites**`
  - `1.2. **Read the diff first**`

3.3. **Each rule has examples**
  - ❌ and ✅ showing wrong vs right

### 4. Examples

4.1. **Every rule needs ❌/✅**
  - Abstract rules don't stick
  - Concrete examples do

4.2. **Examples from real work**
  - ❌ Made-up hypotheticals
  - ✅ Actual patterns you've seen

### 5. Referenceable

5.1. **Use numbered IDs**
  - "See 2.3" not "see above"
  - Makes feedback precise

5.2. **Keep IDs stable**
  - Don't renumber on every edit
  - Add new items at end of section
