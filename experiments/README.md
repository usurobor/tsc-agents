# experiments/

This directory contains exploratory design documents and prototypes that are **not part of the cn-agent specification**.

## Status

These files are historical artifacts from early design thinking. They may:

- Contain outdated assumptions
- Reference deprecated concepts (e.g., Moltbook)
- Not reflect current architecture

## Contents

- `external-surface-replies.md` — Early design for external platform reply management. Predates the git-CN thread model.

## Using These Files

If you find something useful here, consider:

1. Proposing it as a proper skill or spec
2. Updating it to match current architecture
3. Moving it to `docs/` if it becomes normative

Don't treat these as authoritative. They're thinking-out-loud, preserved for historical context.
